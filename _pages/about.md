I'm a Ph.D candidate at [Machine Learning and Intelligence Lab](https://mli.kaist.ac.kr/) (MLILab) in KAIST, advised by [Prof. Eunho Yang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UWO1mloAAAAJ).

### Generalization and Optimization in Deep Learning
My scholarly pursuit is centered on a **fundamental comprehension of the generalization and optimization mechanisms of deep learning models through the lens of loss landscape**, alongside the advancement of learning algorithms informed by deep theoretical insights. I have engaged in extensive studies concerning the scale-invariance of sharpness within the loss landscape, which is widely acknowledged as a proxy of the generalization capability of deep learning models. Furthermore, I have explored the efficacy of sharpness-aware minimization by analyzing its role in overcoming local optima and achieving convergence within asymmetrical valleys. Recently, my research has expanded to incorporate these foundational insights into contemporary frameworks, such as LoRA fine-tuning for compressed large language models and mixture of experts.

### Large Language Models
My research within the domain of large language models bifurcates into two main themes: 1) **Light-weigthening**: This line of inquiry concentrates on reducing the model size or computational overhead of large language models to improve their operational efficiency. Currently, I am engaged in developing methodologies for knowledge distillation, sub 4-bit post-training quantization and speculative decoding. 2) **Fine-tuning**: My recent efforts are directed towards refining the fine-tuning processes for quantized models. The goal of this research is to devise a quantization algorithm tailored for large language models that dynamically adapts during fine-tuning, thus transcending the limitations of traditional data-free or generic corpus-based quantization approaches.
